# calculator

In this project, I will be making a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Created the basic UI of the calculator.
Added a small amount of CSS just to center the calculator, and give it some substance, meaning a border, and width/height.
Created the mathematical functionality using JavaScript.
Figured out the 'equals' bug, so the numbers don't suddenly switch back to 0, or give NaN as a result.

All that is left to do, is finish up the CSS to really make it pop.
This part I will come back and finish, then update this README as I do so.
But for now, I will continue with the course.
I will come back to this later, to really make this basic UI into a great UI.
