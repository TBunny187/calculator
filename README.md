# calculator

In this project, I will be making a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

After looking through what is being asked, I only need add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
At least, from the very start that's all I need to do.

The rest of the basic design will be the same:

Create a main div as the calculator itself.
Create a div for the 'screen'.
Create another div for the buttons.
Possibly use an HR to seperate the screen and the buttons.
